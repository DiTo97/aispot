# AI Spot

**The first community of tech enthusiasts at UniGe**

AI Spot is an upcoming initiative at UniGe for the students, by the students, established with community-driven objectives that aim to foster innovation, and cultivate a technical society to share, create, and engage the like-minded and passionate.

Our prime objective is to create a network of independent thinkers to help nurture and encourage ground-level discussions to assist our community in being informed technologically and updated with state-of-the-art advancements, with a special emphasis around artificial intelligence. We plan to establish interesting and new ways to empower, explore, and develop a knowledge-first network.

With this, we anticipate creating a five-pronged cross-over between:

1. Students
2. Industry
3. Subject matter rxperts
4. Specialist groups
5. Academicians

Our tentative agenda includes two different tracks:
- **Technical activities**  
Open to any motivated student, with the aim of learning state-of-the-art technologies for the next generation of intelligent machines;

- **Dissemination**  
Open to everyone, with the aim of popularizing hot topics and important news about technologies and artificial intelligence.
